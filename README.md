# Homework 2
Hit me, baby, one more time!
## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1. Review basic Object Oriented Principles
2. Allow students to explore using the Python programming language

## Program
A *simple* Black Jack game: play should occur based on the following rules https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/.

### Testing Requirements
Create a suite of unit and integration tests for your Black Jack game. If you're finding it difficult to test your code, refactor it so you can reach at least 70% unit test coverage and you have integration tests to test interactactions between your classes.

### Game Requirements
Implement a Black Jack game which only needs to accommodate one player. There should be a "dealer" following the Dealer's Play rules. Your code should be modular and follow best Object Oriented Programming practices.

Betting is not necessary, nor is a fancy UI (although you can implement them if you want). A player should be dealt cards according to the rules of the game, and they should be able to progress through a hand until they've won or loss. They should be able to play multiple hands until they choose to quit the game.

## Submission details

2.	Type 
```git clone clone URL```
3.	cd into your new assignment directory
4.	After working on your files
5.	When you’re ready, type the following commands:
